            An Ideal Husband
        </h3>
        <h5>
            Act 2: In the second act, which takes place at
            Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to
            fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife.
            He also reveals that he and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly
            engaged. After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert,
            Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel. He also
            takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be
            less morally inflexible and more forgiving. Once Goring
            leaves, Mrs. Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a
            brooch she lost the previous evening. Incensed at Sir
            Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes
            Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room.
            Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern
            then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.

            <p class="speech">I didn’t think so then.  I don’t think
            so now.  Wealth has given me enormous power.  It gave me at the very
            outset of my life freedom, and freedom is everything.  You have never
            been poor, and never known what ambition is.  You cannot understand what
            a wonderful chance the Baron gave me.  Such a chance as few men get.</p>

            very rich man.  I was dazed at the prospect he held out to me, and my
            ambition and my desire for power were at that time boundless.  Six weeks
            later certain private documents passed through my hands.</p>

            <h6 class="name">LORD GORING</h6>
            <p class="speech">I had no idea that you, of all men in the world, could have
            been so weak, Robert, as to yield to such a temptation as Baron Arnheim
            held out to you.</p>

            <p class="speech">Weak?  Oh, I am sick of hearing that phrase.  Sick
            of using it about others.  Weak?  Do you really think, Arthur, that it is
            weakness that yields to temptation?  I tell you that there are terrible
            temptations that it requires strength, strength and courage, to yield to.
            To stake all one’s life on a single moment, to risk everything on one
            throw, whether the stake be power or pleasure, I care not—there is no
            weakness in that.  There is a horrible, a terrible courage.  I had that
            courage.  I sat down the same afternoon and wrote Baron Arnheim the
            letter this woman now holds.  He made three-quarters of a million over
            the transaction.</p>

            <p class="speech">No; that money gave me exactly what I wanted, power
            over others.  I went into the House immediately.  The Baron advised me in
            finance from time to time.  Before five years I had almost trebled my
            fortune.  Since then everything that I have touched has turned out a
            success.  In all things connected with money I have had a luck so
            extraordinary that sometimes it has made me almost afraid.  I remember
            having read somewhere, in some strange book, that when the gods wish to
            punish us they answer our prayers.</p>

            <p class="speech">I don’t say that I suffered any remorse.  I didn’t.
            Not remorse in the ordinary, rather silly sense of the word.  But I have
            paid conscience money many times.  I had a wild hope that I might disarm
            destiny.  The sum Baron Arnheim gave me I have distributed twice over in
            public charities since then.</p>
