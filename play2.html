            Act 2: In the second act, which takes place at
            Sir Robert's house, Lord Goring urges Sir Robert to
            fight Mrs. Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife.
            He also reveals that he and Mrs. Cheveley were formerly
            engaged. After finishing his conversation with Sir Robert,
            Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel. He also
            takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be
            less morally inflexible and more forgiving. Once Goring
            leaves, Mrs. Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a
            brooch she lost the previous evening. Incensed at Sir
            Robert's reneging on his promise, she ultimately exposes
            Sir Robert to his wife once they are both in the room.
            Unable to accept a Sir Robert now unmasked, Lady Chiltern
            then denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.

            <p class="speech">Never mind what I say, Robert!  I am always saying what I
            shouldn’t say.  In fact, I usually say what I really think.  A great
            mistake nowadays.  It makes one so liable to be misunderstood.  As
            regards this dreadful business, I will help you in whatever way I can.
            Of course you know that.</p>

            <p class="speech">Well, the English can’t stand a man who is always saying
            he is in the right, but they are very fond of a man who admits that he has
            been in the wrong.  It is one of the best things in them.  However, in your
            case, Robert, a confession would not do.  The money, if you will allow me to
            say so, is ... awkward.  Besides, if you did make a clean breast of the whole
            affair, you would never be able to talk morality again.  And in England a
            man who can’t talk morality twice a week to a large, popular, immoral
            audience is quite over as a serious politician.  There would be nothing
            left for him as a profession except Botany or the Church.  A confession
            would be of no use.  It would ruin you.</p>
